/**
 * How a ride crosses the wire.
 *
 * Sample streams are typed arrays, and JSON has no way to carry one — an array
 * of 20,000 numbers as text is roughly six times the bytes and has to be parsed
 * one token at a time on arrival. Each channel travels as base64 of its raw
 * buffer instead, which is 4/3 of the binary size and decodes in one call.
 *
 * Measured on a real library: 52 bytes per sample raw, 18 gzipped, so a 1000
 * hour season is about 62 MB compressed. That is small enough that the streams
 * live in Postgres next to the metadata rather than in object storage, and it
 * is why syncing a whole history is a few minutes rather than an afternoon.
