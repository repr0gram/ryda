 * Authentication.
 *
 * Better Auth rather than Auth.js: Auth.js was handed to the Better Auth team
 * in September 2025 and its v5 is still beta years on, with its own maintainers
 * recommending Better Auth for new projects. Sessions live in our database,
 * which also gives immediate revocation.
 *
 * Email and password only. There is no third-party provider to connect —
 * rides arrive as files — so an OAuth dependency would buy nothing.
